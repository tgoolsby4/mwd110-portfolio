  <h1>The Fibonacci Sequence</h1><br><br>
  <p class="five">
    The Fibonacci Sequence is a classic mathematics problems in which a collection of fibonacci numbers is given. A specific fibonacci number denoted F<sub>n</sub> is the sum of the two previous fibonacci numbers.

      <p class="five">There are some preliminary base cases for the Fibonacci Sequence. The first and second fibonacci numbers are both 1. To give this in terms of fibonacci numbers; F<sub>1</sub> = 1, F<sub>2</sub> = 1. Therefore, in order to caluculate F<sub>3</sub>, we would have to take the sum of the two previous fibonacci numbers, so F<sub>3</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub>. If a value of 0 is provided, the resulting Fibonacci Sequence will simply have a value of 0 since there are no previous values to add together.</p>
