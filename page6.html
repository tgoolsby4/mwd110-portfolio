      Topic: The "a" tag <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      The "a" tag is used to define a hyperlink within a webpage. The most important attribute of the "a" tag is the href attribute. This allows the user to place a url to a specific website. This url can either be presented as a url, or be hidden behind a user defined word or phrase. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      This topic will be very useful going forward because websites use many references to other websites. It would be very hard to find a website that didn't have a hyperlink to another url somewhere. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      It was not that difficult at all to work with this topic. The topic itself is fairly straighforward since it such a basic tag within an html file. The simplest form of this tag is almost natural to work with. However, a little more complexity arises when working with some of the other attributes of the "a" tag. <br>

      Topic: The "div" tag <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      The "div" tag is an essential tag to formatting a webpage. It allows for vertical divisions of sections on a webpage. The "div" tag allows you to define your own class with various attributes. Some of the basic attributes for a "div" class are border, background-color, and text-align. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      Formatting is extremely important when making a well designed website. Without proper formatting, it would be difficult to follow the flow of a website. Furthermore, when given a job to design a website for a company or some kind of product, one of the most frequently asked for aspects is readability. The "div" tag allows for strong control over the vertical formatting of any website. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      This topic was slightly more difficult than the previous topic because there is a little more you're able to do. There is much more freedom with creativity since you can define multiple different attributes in your own "div" class. I found that I was able to get the hang of this topic after tinkering around with the w3schools interactive example. I know that I will get much more practice with this tag as this class goes on, so I am looking forward to getting more and more comfortable with the "div" tag. <br>

      Topic: The "audio" and "iframe" tags <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      The "audio" tag allows the user to place an audio clip of multiple different types of audio files, such as .mp3, .mp4, .ogg, etc. The "iframe" tag allows the user to embed other websites into the html code. We worked mainly with embedding YouTube videos, however, the "iframe" tag allows for just about any other website to be embedded. Length and width dimensions can be changed. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      Many websites use audio clips to give more excitement to the page as well as show examples of certain things. Furthermore, embedding another website, especially embedding YouTube videos. If I want to make an educational website in the future, being able to have playable YouTube videos on my site would be very useful. Overall, both of these tags allow for more customization of a website as well as enhance the website user's experience. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      The "iframe" tag was very easy to use considering YouTube videos have an option to share the video as an embedded "iframe" block in an html file. Furtheromore, the most difficult part was working with the size dimensions of the video. The "audio" tag on the other hand, was a little more difficult to get a hang of. I had difficulty at first with being able to actually access an .mp3 file, however, I figured out how to do it by putting the audio file's source address in the src field of the "audio" tag. Other than that, both of these tags were quite easy to understand, and I look forward to working with them more and personalizing my future websites. <br>

      Topic: The "button" tag <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      The "button" tag is used to create clickable buttons on a webpage. This button can be programed to bring up a text prompt in most web browsers. The button has customizable text and the size of the button will grow with the size of the text written. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      This topic will be one of the most most important tools going forward. Buttons are used everywhere on websites and allow for access to other parts of websites. Just in the w3schools site, we see how a button is used to update and run code that is written in the live html envrionments. Furthermore, buttons allow for better linkage between sections of a website, since many different pages can be linked to through a simple button. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      This topic was not too difficult to work with. I assume that as we learn more about the "button" tag it may become a little more difficult due to many different customizations. I found a way to connect an audio file, in my code a mp3 file specifically, to a button so that when the button is clicked, the user is greeted with sound. I think a lot more uses like this are possible with the "button" tag and I can't wait to build upon my knowledge of buttons.<br>

      Date: 02/23/21 <br>
      Topic: The "style" tag <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      The "style" tag is one of the essential tags for creating and designing a website. This tag allows the user to change aspects like background color, font color, font alignment, font style, etc. The "style" tag is also written in css, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. A separate css file can be created that defines all the different stylistic aspects of a webpage. Then, those styles can be referenced in an html file.<br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      The "style" tag, as I stated above, is one of the essential aspects of website design. It will be used in almost every peice of html code that I write from now on. The "style" tag allows for a webpage to go from plain text and pictures, to something that brings in color and user created design. Furthermore, in the future, if I need to make a website for a project or a company I will have to utilize the "style" tag to design the website.<br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      This topic was not too bad to work on, however, we only went over very basic aspects of this tag today. I know as we go on, throughout the semester, we will learn about more aspects of this specific tag. I think learning how to create our own css files with customized styles won't be too bad since I have a good amount of Java background, and the way the styles are defined look very similar to that of Java classes. I think this is one great step towards learning more about website design and structure and the "style" tag is definitely something I will be using throughout the rest of my career in CS.<br>

      Topic: Styling using CSS <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a programming language that is used a lot in HTML files to create unique classes for different aspects of HTML. CSS can be defined in its own file using class definitions, or it can be used inline and through IDs in HTML code. Typically, the easiest way to use CSS is in a separate .css file, however, using ID definitions in an HTML file are good for isolated cases. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      Using CSS is one of the essential aspects of internet programming. Without CSS, the way that web pages are currently styled would not be possible. I am also taking CS275 this semster which is a introduction to internet programming. This class already is asking for the use of CSS files, and through learning about the different ways of using CSS, I can utilize this knowledge to my advantage in this class. Furthermore, if I pursue a career that involves a good amount of internet programming, or only a miniscule amount, I will most likely be using CSS to accomplish just about any website style. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      This topic was not terrible to work on because I have a lot of experience working with Java, and CSS feels very similar to Java. When creating your own CSS file, you define classes and the class fields associated with that class, such as background color, or border thickness, or text color, etc. This felt very similar to Java class definitions so I found the syntax in CSS to be very intuitive. Overall, I know that I will be using CSS throughout the rest of this semester extensively and I am excited to see what possibilities this opens up for my styling of web pages. <br>

      Topic: Selecting colors using CSS <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      When writing code both in CSS and in HTML, there are multiple different ways to create certain colors for your we page. There are millions and millions of different colors in the world, so we need some way to represent those number numerically so that our computer can understand them. In CSS, there are four main ways of representing a color. The first being the name of the color, "red", the second is to use a hex code represented by 6 hexidecimal values, #ff0000, the third being rgb codes which are represented by three numbers (one for red, one for greed, and one for blue), rgb(255,0,0), and the last way is to use hsl codes which are represented by three numbers (one for the degree location of the color on a color wheel, one for the saturation of the color, and one for the luminosity of the color), hsl(0,100%,50%). <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      This topic is going to be extremely useful going forward since color is used instinctually when designing any web page. Many times, it is a good idea to start off with a color palette to help drive the direction of your web page design. Without color, we would just be looking at a white web page with black text, which would make distinction between web pages virtually impossible. Color is essential to experiencing the world around us, so being able to represent colors numerically helps us experience all of these colors within a single web page.<br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      This week's topic was not too difficult to get the hang of. Since last week we were introduced to the idea of coding in CSS, I found the idea of representing colors in these different ways to be very interesting. I already knew about rgb codes as well as hex codes, so the only new representation that I learned was the hsl code. I have found that I like the hsl codes the most and I will be using these from now on to represent my colors in future coding projects. I am excited to use this wide range of ability within the hsl codes to further create immersive and well designed web pages. <br>

      Topic: Introduction to JavaScript <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      This week, we began working some introductory basics in the JavaScript programming language. Specifically, we looked at variable types and variable definitions. I found the variable definitions to be very similar to that of Java, except you do not need to specify the type of the variable in the definition. You just specify the type of the variable during the instantiation of the variable. We learned about five main variable types: Integers, Strings, booleans, lists, and Objects. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      Just like some previous topics, this topic will be essential to my development as a web developer. JavaScript is extremely important in making interactive and engaging web pages. There is only so much that can be accomplished by only using HTML and CSS, since both of the languages are just meta languages. With the introduction of a proprer programming language like JavaScript, I have so many more possibilities to create menus, moving objects on a web page, the list goes on and on. I am very excited to learn more about JavaScript and grow my knowledge on this language. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      Learning about the different types of variables was not too difficult. I found that with my extensive background in Java, I was able to pick up on the basics of JavaScript pretty quickly. I know that it will become more difficult as time goes on, partially because it has been a bit of time since I have worked with Java, and because there are going to be syntax differences. However, regardless of how much more involved JavaScript becomes, I am thoroughly excited to dive deep into what possibilities there are and I look forward to the website layouts and designs I will be able to accomplish. <br>

      Date: 04/01/21 <br>
      Topic: JavaScript functions <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      In JavaScript, the main way to integrate it into your HTML web page is through functions. Functions are used to allow the user to interact with the webpage. Whether it be through buttons, or text on the screen, or images, the list goes on and on. The core technology in web pages is JavaScript, and it allows for personalization and seamless integration of interactive ideas and the final product of a web page. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      As I stated earlier, JS functions are an essential next step in creating more interactive web pages. Before, we were just working with HTML and CSS, which those two together allow for a lot of personalization. However, the limitations of that personalization can be seen quickly. Thus, by integrating JS functions into a project, we can create links to new pages on the site, to buttons that activate a whole new section of the web page. Without JS function, or really any JS at all, web pages would be quite boring and users would lose interest very quickly. I know that if I am ever in a position where I need to design and implement a web page, JS is an essential part to help create a well designed and user interactive final product.<br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      This week's topic was not too difficult to work on as I have a great deal of experience in coding languages like Java. JS has come quite naturally to me, other than refreshing my brain with the syntax. The introduction of functions has brought up a new and exciting chapter of challeneges and ideas that I can now visualize. I am excited to work on assignments and projects that have to do with JS in the future now that I am able to create functions. In some of my other classes, I am beginning to work with JS as well, so I am happy to have so much practice available to me. I forsee myself getting quite comfortable with JS and all the interactive possibilities that come along with it! <br>

      Date: 04/08/21 <br>
      Topic: JavaScript Arrays <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q1: Explain what the topic is <br>
      Arrays are simple data structures that allow for data to be stored. In JavaScript, arrays can be used in multiple ways where values can be added using indexing, or using the stack concept. With indexing, JavaScript arrays are index from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of elements in the array. On the other hand, using the idea of stacks, values can be added to the array using the push() function. In order to remove a value from the array using the stack concept, the pop() command must be used, and the top, or last value, will be removed since stacks operate on a first in last out, FILO ordering. <br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q2: Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward <br>
      Arrays are going to be a very important part to creating efficient web pages since large amounts of data will be collected and stored. Prevously, without knowledge of JS arrays, we would have had to store each variable as it's own separate instance. Arrays allow for easy and quick organization of assiciated variables. Overall, arrays are used a lot in any other programming language that I have used, so I am sure that arrays in JS will be imperative to furthering my development of a web developer.<br>
      ------------------------------ <br>
      Q3: How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic <br>
      This topic was fairly easy for me since I have worked with arrays in almost all of my CS and data science courses throughout my time at UHart. Furthermore, arrays are a very simple data structure, so understanding their nature and operations was a very quick process. I enjoyed looking at arrays in a stack concept since the idea of stacks intruige me and I enjoy the multiple ways in which programming data structures can be interpreted. I am excited to get working with arrays in JS, especially as we begin our final projects for this course!<br>
